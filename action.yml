  # Specify the actions you want to perform.

  # Signing embeds a cryptographic signature of a code or application in the
  # entity being signed.
  sign:
    description: 'Whether to sign'
    default: 'true'

  # Notarizing uploads a signed asset to Apple for scanning. If notarization
  # is successful, Apple issues a "notarization ticket," which proves the
  # validity of an entity.
  notarize:
    description: 'Whether to notarize'
    default: 'false'

  # Attaches a pre-issued "notarization ticket" to an entity.
  staple:

    default: 'false'

  # Specify rcodesign.toml config file(s) and an optional named profile
  # to use. See https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/stable/apple_codesign_rcodesign_config_files.html
  # for more on config files.
  #
  # You can use multiline YAML syntax to define multiple files. e.g.
  # 
  # config_file: |
  #   file_1.toml
  #   file_2.toml

  # For signing, choose the source of the code signing certificate from the
  # following sets.

  # Multiline YAML syntax is supported for defining multiple files.

  # This setting only provides the public certificate. It needs to be combined
  # with an additional setting that provides the private key corresponding to
  # this certificate.

    description: 'Path to a file containing a DER encoded X.509 certificate'

  # For remote signing, you need to specify a mechanism to initialize the
  # secure signing session. We highly recommend using public key encryption
  # instead of a shared secret. See
  # https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/stable/apple_codesign_remote_signing.html#session-agreement
  # for more on the topic.

  # You can obtain the public key by running `rcodesign analyze-certificate`,
  # `rcodesign smartcard-scan`, `rcodesign keychain-print-certificates`, and
  # other `rcodesign` commands to inspect code signing certificates.
